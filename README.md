# RL(HF) and LLM Reasoning Summary Notes

Welcome to my collection of study notes related to **Reinforcement Learning (Human Feedback)** and **Large Language Model Reasoning**. This repository is an evolving resource, containing literature references and personal summaries of the topics I’m currently exploring. 

My notes draw on public information from Arxiv, with all opinions being my own.


## Overview

- **Purpose**: The aim of this repository is to share my ongoing learning process and provide an indexed collection of research articles and conceptual overviews in topics related to RL(HF) and LLM reasoning.
- **Scope**: Notes include brief summaries, personal annotations, and relevant citations.

## Index of Notes

Below is an index of the Markdown files currently available in the `Notes` folder, along with brief descriptions.

1. **[Intro_RLHF.md](Notes/Intro_RLHF.md)**  
   *A brief and partial summary of RLHF algorithms by the end of 2024. It summarizes a list of papers and useful blogs for RLHF that are covered in my reading group presentation of a brief summary for RLHF algorithms. Please find the slides [here](/Slides/Intro_RLHF_Reading_Group.pdf).*

2. **[Reward_Hacking.md](Notes/Reward_Hacking.md)**

3. **[R1_reasoning.md](Notes/R1_reasoning.md)**
